## Analysis of bias in headlines against Electric Vehicles by UK Mainstream Media


## Abstract

This study analysed the sentiment of mainstream media headlines towards electric vehicles (EVs) from August to January, capturing a dataset of 1,976,938 datapoints across ten prominent UK publications, including 

- The Sun
- The Express
- The Times
- The Telegraph
- Daily Mail
- Economist 
- The BBC
- The Independent 
- The Spectator
- The Daily Star

 Notably, The Telegraph, The Spectator, The Independent, and the Daily Mail were responsible for over 73% of all EV-related headlines, highlighting their disproportionate influence on public discourse.

The analysis reveals a concerning trend: as the peak new registration period for electric vehicles approached in September, sentiment towards them shifted dramatically, with an increase in negative language. This study's findings suggest that mainstream media outlets may be playing a significant role in shaping public perception of EVs, and further research is needed to understand the implications of this phenomenon on the adoption and development of sustainable transportation solutions.
