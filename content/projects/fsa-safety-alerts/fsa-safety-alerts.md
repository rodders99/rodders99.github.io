## Did you know that 34% of all food safety alerts[^1] are issued to grocery retailers for own brand products, yet the origin of many products remains largely unknown?

As we explore the complexities of food safety in the UK, let's start by peeling back the layers and uncovering the truth behind our daily diets.

Food safety is a critical issue in the UK. Millions of people are affected by foodborne illnesses every year. These illnesses can range from mild discomfort to life-threatening complications.

[^1]: Since 2014. 2021 to 2024 ytd 30% of all safety alerts are issued to Grocers

## Report Objective

In this report, I delve into the complexities of food safety in the UK. I examine the trends, patterns, and areas for improvement, to better understand the issues.

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive visual overview of food safety alerts issued by the UK Food Standards Agency, with a focus on major food categories and their corresponding contamination risks. By presenting a range of visualizations, including stacked bar plots, pie chart and time-series plots. The objective is to provide readers with valuable insights into the types of contaminants that pose the greatest threats to consumer health. By visualizing the data, I have improved accessibility, and in turn, I hope that this helps empower policymakers, industry professionals, and consumers with data-driven insights that inform their decisions on food safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

The report's objective is threefold.

- Firstly, it aims to provide a broad overview of the distribution of food safety alerts across different categories, highlighting areas where contamination risks are particularly high.
- Secondly, it seeks to drill down into specific food categories, presenting detailed visualizations that illustrate the types and frequencies of contaminants associated with each category.
- Finally, the report aims to facilitate comparison and analysis between different food categories, enabling stakeholders to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in food safety practices. 

By achieving these objectives, I hope to contribute to a safer and more informed food system in the UK, and assuage my intense curiosity about how safe UK food really is (Hint, we're good ....)

The main goal of this analysis is to provide data-driven insights that inform policymakers, industry professionals, and consumers about effective strategies for managing food safety risks in the UK. By visualizing the data, I aim to improve accessibility and empower stakeholders with actionable recommendations that can help reduce foodborne illnesses and ensure a safer food system.

# Fun and Entertaining Risks found in our food supply (found in the dataset)

While carrying out EDA, a number of alerts caught my eye since they were so far outside the normal list of pathogens and contaminants. It is important to note, in nearly all instances the appearance of these contaminants in food products were one-offs and should not be cause for concern.

## Aflatoxins

### What are Aflatoxins
Aflatoxins are a group of toxic compounds produced by certain moulds (Aspergillus species) that grow in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains. These moulds, primarily 
Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, can contaminate food crops and pose serious health risks to both humans and animals.

### Key Characteristics and Facts about Aflatoxins:

- **Toxicity and Carcinogenicity:**
    - Aflatoxins are highly toxic and are considered one of the most potent naturally occurring carcinogens.
    - They can cause liver damage and are associated with an increased risk of liver cancer.
    - Chronic exposure to low levels of aflatoxins can also lead to immune suppression and other health issues.

- **Health Impacts:**
    - Acute aflatoxin poisoning (aflatoxicosis) can lead to severe liver damage, acute hepatitis, jaundice, and, in extreme cases, death.
    - Long-term exposure to low levels of aflatoxins is associated with a range of health problems, including liver cancer, stunted growth in children, and compromised immune function.

## Aluminium phosphide 

### What is Aluminium phosphide
Aluminium phosphide (AlP) is a highly toxic chemical compound commonly used as a fumigant to control pests, such as insects and rodents, in various industries like agriculture, forestry, and construction. 
It's also known as aluminum phosphide or aluminum monophosphide.

### Uses

- **Fumigation:** AlP is used to kill pests by releasing toxic phosphine gas when it comes into contact with moisture.
- **Insecticide:** It's used to control insects in stored products, such as grains and other agricultural commodities.
- **Rodenticide:** AlP is used to kill rodents, like rats and mice, in various settings.

### Risks if found in food
