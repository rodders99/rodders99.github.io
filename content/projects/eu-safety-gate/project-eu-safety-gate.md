## The EU Safety Gate project

About this Project


The Safety Gate rapid alert system plays an important role
enabling swift and effective action to be taken across the single
market when a dangerous product is found.

Exchange of information on dangerous non-food products kicked
off informally in 2001. It became compulsory in 2002 under the
General Product Safety Directive which set up the rapid alert system
for dangerous non-food products. In December 2024, the General
Product Safety Regulation will replace the Directive and the rapid
alert system will officially be renamed Safety Gate.

EU Safety Gate is The data in this report and is based on information from national
authorities on measures taken against dangerous non-food products.

Data has been sourced from [Safety Gate Web Site](https://ec.europa.eu/safety-gate/).

### Data Meta Data


This information includes various risks that they have identified,
mainly to consumersâ€™ health and safety but also to the environment
or risks in relation to professional products (i.e. products not
normally available to consumers). The report also takes into account
data related to information exchanged among member countries
that is not published on the Safety Gate website.
The report presents statistics on the rapid alert system. It does not
purport to give a comprehensive picture of all dangerous products
on the single market, nor does it give an overview of all market
surveillance efforts undertaken by the EU/EEA national authorities.
Due to the dynamic nature of the system, the data may vary
depending on the time of extraction.
