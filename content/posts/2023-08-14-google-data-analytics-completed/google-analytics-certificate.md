## A Milestone Achieved

Completing the Google Data Analytics Specialization on Coursera ðŸ“Š

A few months ago, I was unfortunately made redundant which gave me the opportunity to reflect and decide what I really wanted to do when I grew up. This little voyage of discovery led me to the world of data analytics and data science and I decided to re-enter education and develop some new skills in these fast growing and changing specialisations.

Having spent my career over the last thirty years buried in Excel spreadsheets and corporate dashboards, preparing for new business ventures, customer or supplier meetings or building plans for future growth, I realised that this was the aspect of my previous role that I really enjoyed. Finding opportunity in data is pretty much what I've been doing and curating this information in to easily digested ideas and presenting this was my "fun" bit of the job.

Having reached a conclusion about my passions and interests, the next step was to learn how to improve and broaden my skill set. The beginning of this journey was the Google Data Analytics Specialisation. While I was really not sure what to expect and suffering from the usual imposter syndrome, I was relieved to find the course extended my existing knowledge of data analytics into the realms of the R Language, Tableau dashboard, BigQuery, Jupyter notebooks as well as the professional ethics and the structured approach demanded of course attendees.

### As I reflect on my recent journey, I am thrilled to share a significant accomplishment â€“ I have successfully completed the Google Data Analytics Specialization course on Coursera. ðŸŽ“ (warning: Linkedin influencer headline)

What was initially projected as a six-month endeavour, I managed to conquer in just six weeks. This achievement is a testament to my dedication, focus, and passion for diving deep into the world of data analytics. ðŸš€ I'm not just saying that because it sounds good, I really found a passion that has been the backbone of my success in the business world over the years and realised I need to make this mu full time role.

Throughout Google Course, I delved into various facets of data analysis, from mastering analytical tools to unravelling complex data sets and visualizing insights. Each module presented its own challenges and triumphs, allowing me to grow both professionally and personally.

This accomplishment holds a special place for me, not just because of the certification I've earned, but because of the invaluable skills and knowledge I've gained. Data analytics is a field that continues to evolve, and I'm excited to apply these newfound skills to real-world scenarios.

I am humbled by the support and encouragement I've received from my friends, family, and mentors. This accomplishment wouldn't have been possible without their unwavering belief in me. a big thanks to the R community and the Tableau community! I learned so much from you.

As I celebrate this milestone, I am reminded that education is a lifelong journey. Completing the Google Data Analytics Specialization is just one step in the broader path of continuous learning and growth.

I look forward to what lies ahead â€“ exploring new opportunities, contributing to data-driven initiatives, and embracing the ever-changing landscape of analytics, getting down and dirty with machine learning and AI.

Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this journey with me. Here's to new beginnings and the excitement of what's to come! ðŸ¥‚
