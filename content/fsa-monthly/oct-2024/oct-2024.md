Infographic generated for UK Food Safety Alert data from the https://food.gov.uk website.

This INFOGRAPHIC is programmatically generated from data that has been scraped, cleansed, categorised, feature engineered, analysed, visualised and managed through a self developed python app using the Streamlit library. 

## October has so far been an exceptional month

So far in October while only 26 alerts have been issued, over 250 different products have been recalled as a cautionary measure, this recall caused by an ingredient used in the manufacture of these products. 

### FGS Ingredients Ltd

Alerts issued by the FSA for products manufactured using a mustard ingredient supplied by FGS Ingredients have been identified as containing possible contamination with peanut. As with most UK Safety Alerts this is an exceptional situation and not an endemic issue with FGS Ingredients, their suppliers or companies that use products from FGS Ingredients. 

The ingredient concerned is a mustard powder and the alert is issued for *possible* peanut contamination. Not all batches of mustard powder from FGS Ingredients are affected and the Food Safety Agency and FGS Ingredients are operating from an overabundance of caution.

FGS are a supplier of ingredients to the food industry : [FGS Web Site](https://www.fgsingredients.com/) where there is a notice on their website explaining what happened and the steps they are taking to rectify the issue.

### Abstract

In this report, I delve into the complexities of food safety in the UK. I examine the trends, patterns, and areas for improvement, to better understand the issues.

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive visual overview of food safety alerts issued by the UK Food Standards Agency, with a focus on major food categories and their corresponding contamination risks. By presenting a range of visualizations, including stacked bar plots, pie chart and time-series plots. The objective is to provide readers with valuable insights into the types of contaminants that pose the greatest threats to consumer health. By visualizing the data, I have improved accessibility, and in turn, I hope that this helps empower policymakers, industry professionals, and consumers with data-driven insights that inform their decisions on food safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

The reportâ€™s objective is threefold.

- Firstly, it aims to provide a broad overview of the distribution of food safety alerts across different categories, highlighting areas where contamination risks are particularly high.
- Secondly, it seeks to drill down into specific food categories, presenting detailed visualizations that illustrate the types and frequencies of contaminants associated with each category.
- Finally, the report aims to facilitate comparison and analysis between different food categories, enabling stakeholders to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in food safety practices.
