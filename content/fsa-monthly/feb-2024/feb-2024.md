### Abstract

In this report, I delve into the complexities of food safety in the UK. I examine the trends, patterns, and areas for improvement, to better understand the issues.

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive visual overview of food safety alerts issued by the UK Food Standards Agency, with a focus on major food categories and their corresponding contamination risks. By presenting a range of visualizations, including stacked bar plots, pie chart and time-series plots. The objective is to provide readers with valuable insights into the types of contaminants that pose the greatest threats to consumer health. By visualizing the data, I have improved accessibility, and in turn, I hope that this helps empower policymakers, industry professionals, and consumers with data-driven insights that inform their decisions on food safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

The reportâ€™s objective is threefold.

- Firstly, it aims to provide a broad overview of the distribution of food safety alerts across different categories, highlighting areas where contamination risks are particularly high.
- Secondly, it seeks to drill down into specific food categories, presenting detailed visualizations that illustrate the types and frequencies of contaminants associated with each category.
- Finally, the report aims to facilitate comparison and analysis between different food categories, enabling stakeholders to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in food safety practices.
