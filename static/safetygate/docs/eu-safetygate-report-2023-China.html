## Total Annual Alerts Issued

Over the last few years, the EU Safetygate team monitor around 2,000 - 2,200 safety alerts per year issued by member states.

## Cumulative Annual Alerts Issued

2023 saw a 59% increase in alerts issued, with the total alerts issued increasing from 2,100 alerts in 2022 to 3,349 in 2023, an increase of 1,249 over the previous year.

# Top Country of origin for Safety Alerts (all countries)
Within the Top 15 countries are two entries one for `other` (where the country isn't in the top 15) and one for `Unknown` (where the reporting member didn't record the country of origin.)

## Annual difference by country

The highlight here is Italy, with Poland, France, Germany and Spain standing out for the increase in alerts.

[![Alt text](EU-Safetygate-Country-2022-2023-difference.png)](EU-Safetygate-Country-2022-2023-difference.png)

However when weighed against the total number of alerts issued to each country by product category, the totals for cosmetics for each remains small.

### BMHCA in cosmetic products

The significant increase seen 2023 over 2022 is due to a change in regulations for a Butylphenyl Methylpropional
(BMHCA, trade name ‘Lilial’) BMHCA,  a chemical commonly used in cosmetics.

BMHCA is now deemed to be hazardous and unsuitable for use in cosmetic products due to the fact that it is included in so many products.  While an individual exposure poses a minimal risk, cumulative exposure from the use of multiple products containing this chemical increases the risk considerably. 

See BMHCA in cosmetics for further information.  It's also worth noting that BMHCA is a fragrance commonly used in household cleaning products, however no guidance has been issued for the it's use in cleaning products at this stage. 

# What happened between 2022-2023?



![BMHCA "Lillial" Molecule](bmhca-molecule.png) BMHCA "Lilial"  Molecule

The reason for this increase is due to the EU introducing a ban on the chemical 2-(4-tert- butylbenzyl) propionaldehyde (BMHCA), which was forbidden in cosmetic products from 2022 onwards. Since 1 March 2022, butylphenyl methylpropional (BMHCA/’Lilial’) is classified as a Carcinogenic, Mutagenic or Reprotoxic (CMR) category 1B substance under the EU and GB Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulations.

This ban affected around 1,100 - 1,200 products (90-95% of the annual increase of (1,249) alerts or 32-35% of all alerts issued (3,349) in 2023), and is the reason for the significant increase seen in the Safetygate analysis.

## Cosmetics
Major brands such as Nivea (Beiersdorf Global AG), Palmolive (Colgate-Palmolive), Vidal (Proctor & Gamble) as directly identifiable brands, have been manufacturing & selling products with a banned chemical in them, for some reason, disregarding the Ban even though their respective trade associations gave plenty of notice.

The ban came into force in 2022, however these companies continued selling products containing the banned chemicals through 2023 resulting in a compulsory or voluntary withdrawal from sale. 

For Nivea 40 products were affected.
Palmolive 30 affected products. One of these is unrelated to the chemical ban. Colgate toothpaste was withdrawn from the market, the alert issued indicates that the product represents a microbiological risk with mesophilic aerobic microorganisms present and could possibly be counterfeit.

The banned chemical is 2-(4-tert- butylbenzyl) propionaldehyde (BMHCA), which is forbidden in cosmetic products. BMHCA may harm the reproductive system, may harm the health of the unborn child and may cause skin sensitisation. 

## UK and BMHCA

Article 15 of the UK and EU Cosmetics Regulations requires CMR-classified substances to undergo an
exemption process to assess whether they can continue to be used as cosmetic ingredients. This regulatory
process has not yet been completed under the UK Cosmetics Regulation. Therefore, the new EU provisions
for BMHCA/’Lilial’ do not apply in GB. However, a ban is expected in GB on 15 December 2022 (the ‘off-
shelf’ date).

While companies have been working towards the deadline of 1 March 2022 for products for both the EU
and UK markets, as advised by CTPA, as of revision date of this statement, BMHCA/’Lilial’ can be legally
used in cosmetic products in GB until:
• 15 October 2022, as placing on the market deadline;
• 15 December 2022, as making available (off-shelf) deadline.

The draft regulation implementing the BMHCA/’Lilial’ ban in GB is still going through the legislative
process, as per this public news. 

CTPA will keep companies updated on any further developments.

The legislative process for BMHCA began before the UK left the EU. It is important to stress that the CMR
classification of BMHCA and the ban now in force in the EU, and expected in GB shortly, is based on the
hazardous properties a substance might have under a "worst case" situation and does not take account of
whether there is any risk associated with specific uses or exposures. Consumers who have bought cosmetic
and personal care products that contain BMHCA, can be reassured that these products are still safe to use.
They will have undergone a rigorous safety assessment by an expert safety assessor to ensure their safe
use.

[https://www.ctpa.org.uk/file.php?fileid=4135](https://www.ctpa.org.uk/file.php?fileid=4135)

This effectively means any products containing BMHCA and produced in the UK will be illegal to export to EU countries. 


## Scientific Opinion on BMHCA

*Does the SCCS consider Butylphenyl methylpropional (p-BMHCA) safe for use as a
fragrance ingredient in cosmetic leave-on and rinse-off type products in a concentration
limit(s) according the ones set up by IFRA as reported above?*

On individual product basis, Butylphenyl methylpropional (p-BMHCA) (CAS 80-54-6) with
alpha-tocopherol at 200 ppm, can be considered safe when used as fragrance ingredient in
different cosmetic leave-on and rinse-off type products. However, considering the first-tier
deterministic aggregate exposure, arising from the use of different product types together,
Butylphenyl methylpropional at the proposed concentrations cannot be considered as safe.
This Opinion is not applicable to the use of p-BMHCA in any sprayable products that could
lead to exposure of the consumer’s lung by inhalation.

*Does the SCCS have any further scientific concerns with regard to the use of Butylphenyl
methylpropional (p-BMHCA) as a fragrance ingredient in cosmetic leave-on and/or rinse-off
type products?*

Evaluation of this substance by other scientific bodies (e.g. under REACH) should also be
taken into consideration by the Applicant for potential future assessment of the substance.
Butylphenyl methylpropional is also used as a fragrance ingredient in some non-cosmetic
products such as household cleaners and detergents. As no specific exposure data were
made available to SCCS to assess exposure following these non-cosmetic uses, it was not
possible to include them in the aggregated exposure scenarios. Therefore, the actual total
exposure of the consumer may be higher than exposure from cosmetic products alone.
