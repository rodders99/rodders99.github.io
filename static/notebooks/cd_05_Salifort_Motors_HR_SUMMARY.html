<h2 id="results-of-analysis">Results of analysis</h2>
<p>Following a comprehensive analysis of the data provided by the HR
department on employees who have left the organization, I have
identified several key factors contributing to employee attrition. It is
crucial to address these issues to enhance employee satisfaction,
engagement, and retention within the company.</p>

<h3 id="eda-observations---last_eval"><a id='toc3_2_5_'></a><a

<p>Those who left fall generally into one of two groups either low
scoring or high scoring with 28% of low scoring employees leaving and
17% of high scoring employees leaving. 46% of employees who left had a
low or medium score, there’s aso a strong correlation to hours worked as
seen on the correlation plot, where those who left also tend to work
more hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a high correlation with <code>satisfaction</code>,

<h3 id="eda-observations---number_project"><a id='toc3_3_4_'></a><a
href="#toc0_">EDA Observations - <code>number_project</code></a></h3>
<p><strong>Caveats</strong> - The number of projects is a simple metric
that does not take into account either the complexity or duration of the
project. A member of staff could only have worked on one project, but
the complexity and duration of the project would not be taken into
account with the available data. There is also a high correlation to the
number of hours worked.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People who left are mostly in the low and medium salary
ranges</p></li>
<li><p>People who left are estimated to cost the business £42M (assuming
30% cost of annual salary to replace)</p></li>
<li><p>45% of employees who worked on 2 or less projects left</p></li>

company</p></li>
<li><p>50% of employees who left, worked on either 2 or less or more

<li><p>Highest retention was with employees who worked on between 3-5
projects where 95% of the staff were retained.</p></li>
<li><p>Lowest retention was with employees who worked on 2 projects, 46%
of the staff were retained or 6+ projects where 3% of the staff were
retained.</p></li>

id="employees-vs-management-to-support-them"><a id='toc3_5_4_2_'></a><a
href="#toc0_">Employees vs management to support them</a></h4>
<p>We are making assumptions here!</p>
<p>We would need some additional information in the dataset to identify
the start year for each employee and which department managers belong
to.</p>
<p>In management circles, it is common knowledge that the ideal number
of direct subordinates a manager should have is 7±2 that is around 8
employees,plus or minus 2.</p>
<h5 id="employee-to-manager-ratio"><a id='toc3_5_4_2_1_'></a><a
href="#toc0_">Employee to Manager Ratio</a></h5>
<p>Currently within Salifort Motors, there are 9616 current employees
(not management) and 384 Managers (not employees). This puts the
employee manager ratio at 23 employees for every manager.</p>
<p>Conventional management thinking of 8 employees per manager, the
client would need to recruit/develop a further 800+ managers to bring
the employee to manager ratio down to more conventional levels.</p>
<p>This also links to the promotion field where the % of employees who
have received promotions in the last five years is very low (1.6%) and
the opportunity to grow management resources within the business is
high.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to the development path for employees
to move into management.</p>

<h2 id="general-recommendations">General Recommendations</h2>
<h3 id="compensation-and-benefits">Compensation and Benefits</h3>
<p>One prominent factor associated with employee departure is low pay.
It is evident that a significant number of departing employees expressed
dissatisfaction with their compensation packages. I recommend a thorough
review of the current salary structures to ensure they align with
industry standards and adequately reward employees for their
contributions.</p>
<h3 id="working-conditions">Working Conditions</h3>
<p>Long working hours and varying project loads have emerged as
significant contributors to employee turnover. Striking a balance
between workload and work-life balance is essential. Addressing these
concerns may involve optimizing project allocation, setting realistic
deadlines, and promoting a healthier work environment.</p>
<h3 id="recognition-and-appreciation">Recognition and Appreciation</h3>
<p>The data indicated a lack of recognition from management as a key
reason for an employees departure. Implementing regular acknowledgment
programs and fostering a culture of appreciation and care can
significantly boost morale and job satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="job-satisfaction">Job Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Self-reported low job satisfaction is a recurring theme among
departing employees. Conducting employee surveys and feedback sessions
can provide valuable insights into specific areas that require
improvement, allowing the organization to tailor interventions to meet
employee needs.</p>
<h3 id="career-growth-opportunities">Career Growth Opportunities</h3>
<p>The absence of promotions and limited career growth opportunities has
been identified as a concern. Initiatives such as mentorship programs,
skill development workshops, and transparent career progression paths
can help retain valuable talent within the organization.</p>
<p>In conclusion, addressing these key factors is imperative for
fostering a positive work environment, retaining talented employees, and
ultimately improving organizational performance. I recommend a strategic
action plan that includes targeted interventions to mitigate these
challenges and enhance overall employee satisfaction.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to these critical matters. I am
available for further discussion and collaboration to implement these
recommendations effectively.</p>

<p>If we apply the model to employees who have already left, effectively
testing the model against known data, we can see that 72% of employees
who left would have been flagged by the ML model as at high risk, and
action perhaps could have been taken before the inevitable. If we lower
the risk threshold threshold to medium risk at 70%, then over 90% of
these employees would have been flagged and if we look to those flagged
above low risk at 50%, 91% of employees would have been flagged.</p>
<p>To put some perspective around this, the level of accuracy
demonstrated by the model is significantly better than a random
guess.</p>
