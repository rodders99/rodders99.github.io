      <description>If you regularly experience any of the symptoms I list in this article, it is entirely possible that like me your migraines may be triggered by something in your diet! This is not medical advice, I am not a Medical Professional, do not take medical advice from internet strangers. If you are suffering from similar symptoms, consider approaching a medical professional before biohacking your life. This was my journey, I hope it brings relief to others.</description>
