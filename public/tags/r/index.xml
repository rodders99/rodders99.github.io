      <description>The EU Safety Gate project Link to heading About this Project Link to heading I first encountered the EU Safetygate in my previous role.
Since 2003, the Safety Gate has enabled a quick exchange of information among EU/EEA Member States and the European Commission about dangerous non-food products posing a risk to the health and safety of consumers. Appropriate follow-up has to be taken by the national authorities so that the notified dangerous products are removed from the market.</description>

SMMT publish data monthly in an image format and this project, grabs that data from the images and processes it into a CSV file suitable for import into Tableau.</description>
